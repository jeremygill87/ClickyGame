# ClickyGame

## Overview

* Click-A-Dick is a web-game application in which users seek the tiniest morsel of joy in the barren hellscape that is politics and society of 2020 by clicking on the images of people who are, objectively, dicks.

* Points are earned by clicking a dick that hasn’t previously been clicked.

* After every click, the dicks shift to the left, right, or wherever. Make sure you don’t click the same dick. Memory!

* You win if you reach 20. But, really, let’s be honest. In this cruel existence, are any of us winners?

## Technology Used

* React.js
* Bootstrap

## The Code

### Beginning
First step was initializing all of the React files. Then making the .gitignore, because I won’t be making that mistake again.

### Coding
Many of the files remain untouched, such as index.html, serviceWorker.js, and the package.json files.

The logic behind the game is relatively straightforward, but navigating the new React syntax and connectivity proved to be a pain in the dick. All too often, my progress was impeded by switching back and forth between tabs, forgetting the names of variables, and working in an inefficient circular pattern.

Then, I realized I could do almost everything in App.js and not worry about any of the components. After that - smooth sailing.

## Components

* Gameboard
All of the images appear here. On each click, they shuffle to a new location.

* Navbar
Wasn’t sure what to call this, but it looks like a navigation bar and I stole the basic framework off of Bootstrap, so here we are. The Navbar gives you messages about your progress and keeps track of the user’s current and high scores.

* Title
Self-explanatory, really.

* Wrapper
Sort of like a big ole hug from your computer. Keeps all the dicks contained.

## The Future
There are new dicks born everyday. Previous heroes (Kanye West and Ricky Gervais) become unrepentant dicks and new dicks emerge into the cultural zeitgeist. Indeed, the possibilities for this game are as endless as the supply of fresh dicks every year.
